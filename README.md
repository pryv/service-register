## Setting up the development environment on a Mac

Read, then execute `./scripts/setup-environment-dev.sh`.


## Deploying with fleet: cheat sheet

1. `fleet deploy` to push current branch (note: must be master!) to all fleet drones
2. `./scripts/fleet-setup-<target>.sh` to setup the target server
3. `fleet stop <process id>` to stop previous instances (use `fleet ps` to list running processes)
4. `/scripts/fleet-spawn-<target>.sh` to start the new instances


## Folder structure

- `db`: config and scripts for the database (Redis)
- `misc-scripts`: some helper scripts
- `source`: TODO: detail structure...
