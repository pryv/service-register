# CHANGES in 1.X

## 1.3.X

- From 1.3.38, most of the parameters required during app authorization will be provided by register within the auth state in response to poll calls. In other words, the auth url generated by register (usually pointing to app-web-auth) will mainly contain a poll key as query parameter. Other parameters such as requestedPermissions, previously provided as query parameters, will only be provided within the polled auth state. This means that previous implementations of the app authorization flow, such as app-web-auth2 or client apps using custom implementation of this flow, will not be compatible with this version of register (and next ones), unless they adapt to rely on the polling result instead of on the query parameters in the auth url.

- Usernames and email addresses are now case insensitive. Also, we've removed 
  limits on the email field, only imposing a length limit of 300 chars. 

- Removes https support. We deploy this behind a WAF or behind an nginx reverse
  proxy, so we don't ever need the https option. Plus: Less options for security
  = more security. 

- Removes the oauth2 configuration value and the code implementing an OAuth2 
  server. This was not used in practice; less functionality = less maintenance. 

## 1.2.X

- By adding a 'certificateAuthorityAuthorization' section in your configuration 
  file, you can now configure CAA records (certificate authority authorisation).

- Fix DNS vulnerability 2018022101: DNS does not answer to DNS replies anymore.

- Fix DNS vulnerability 2018022102: DNS now explicitely advertise that it is not recursive.

- Remove 2 optional unused services (ssh and cron) from our docker image.

- invitation tokens for user creation is now customisable administrator can:
  - remove check for invitationToken
  - disable user creation
  - define a list of valid tokens
